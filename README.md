# AREC-615-Project
This repository contains a replication of the paper *"Agricultural Productivity and Soil Carbon Dynamics: A Bioeconomic Model"* by Berazneva et al. (2019). I extended this paper to examine how a carbon flow subsidy affects farmers' decisions and the resulting impacts on producers' welfare and carbon accumulation.

The main finalized document is located in the **manuscript** folder, and the extension model code is in the **extension** folder.
